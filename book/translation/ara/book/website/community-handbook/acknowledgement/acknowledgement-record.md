# Record of Contributions

يتم استخدام وثيقتين في [مستودع GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) لإنشاء سجل للمساهمات في _طريق التوريد_: طاولة المساهمين في [`إعادة الارتقاء`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/README.md) الملف، و

`المساهمون.
This record is made available in the afterword of this book as {ref}<code>Contributors<contributors-record-contributors>` and {ref}`Personal Highlights<contributors-record-highlights>`. These documents can be used for highlighting skills that our members have gained and shared through their involvement in _The Turing Way_.</p> 

We invite all our members to co-create this record to capture the important work they do around answering questions, representing the project, developing and maintaining the infrastructure, and all other nurturing roles that make The Turing Way community so special.

The process of developing this record is described below in detail.



## 1. Contributors Table

The [Contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#contributors) table in [`README`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/README.md) file is updated with every contributor's name using the [all contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/)'s [emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key).

No contribution is too small, and these emojis allow us to recognise and fairly acknowledging all kinds of contributions our community members make to the project. Those contributions can include (but are not limited to) bug fixing, chapter planning, writing, editing, reviewing, idea generation, presentation, project management, and maintenance. Please see the subchapter {ref}`Acknowledgement Examples <ch-acknowledgement-examples>` for details.

## 2. Contributors file

The contributors file, called [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) in the GitHub repository, will hold specific details provided by community members regarding their involvements in the project. This will be referred to as `contributor's detail` in the rest of this document:



> `اسم المساهم` * دور: `هذا هو عنصر اختياري لأي دور محدد قام به المساهمون في المشروع. It is also a place to mention the date/year since a contributor has taken this role. أمثلة: "مساهم أساسي (2018 حتى الآن)"، أو قيادة الترجمة (2020)، أو عضو لجنة مدونة قواعد السلوك (2019-2020).` * معرف GitHub `GitHub id, مثال: [@kirstiejane](http://github. om/kirstiejane)` * ORCID: `معرف المساهم، مثال: [0000-0001-8498-4059](https://orcid. rg/0000-0001-8498-4059)` * قصير بيو: `1-2 جمل عن نفسها`

Then, our contributors will add "Personal highlights", which will hold details of their contributions to _The Turing way_:


> * Personal highlights: `GitHub contributions, PRs and issues. Further details have been discussed below.`

Additionally, contributors can opt to add more information they think can help them share their work and engagement with _The Turing Way_ project by supplementing "More information":


> * More information: `Additional information provided by the contributors. This is optional.`



### Personal highlights

Specifications for all types of contributions made towards _The Turing Way_ can be added in the [contributors file](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) as personal highlights.

These highlights can be individually decided by the contributors to record what they consider to be their significant and useful for their personal profile. This can be supplemented with supporting materials such links to chapters, pull request, issues, and blog posts.

This record can be directly translated towards the professional development of our community members, which can be further used for enhancing their personal or professional portfolio (profile, CV, resume) (see the [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/edit/acknowledging-contributors/contributors.md) file).

_The Turing Way_ was originally funded by a [Strategic Priority Fund](https://www.ukri.org/research/themes-and-programmes/strategic-priorities-fund/) investment to the Alan Turing Institute to support [AI For Science and Government](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg). The personal highlights are very valuable for capturing the impact that _The Turing Way_ has for its community members in terms of personal networking, professional development, skill sharing and other relevant activities, and how they have made positive impacts around transparency, reproducibility and ethical collaboration in their organisation.



### Recording different types of contributions

In the contribution types discussed below, we use scenarios from some of the most common contribution types.

These examples are also outlined in the next subchapter {ref}`Acknowledgement Examples <ch-acknowledgement-examples>` along with other types of contributions that are made to _The Turing Way_.

**نوصي باستخدام هذه الأمثلة من العبارات فقط كدليل.** كمساهم، ستتمكن من إضافة أكبر عدد من التفاصيل المفيدة لسجلك.



#### Bug fixes

*A "bug" is a small error in the text or code like typo, formatting issue or broken links.*

#### Reviewing chapters and other pull requests

*The review process of a newly contributed chapter or a subsection of an existing chapter involves approving the language and structure of a chapter or a section of a chapter, flagging errors or typos, asking for clarifications if certain parts of the content or statements are unclear, suggesting modifications and improving the overall quality of someone's contribution.*

Such organisational supports are applicable when one or multiple members from a project or community collaborate to build resources in _The Turing Way_.*

Each organisation who supports its members to collaborate with _The Turing Way_ will be listed as "Collaborating organisations" in the contributor's file. Each contributor from these organisation will be acknowledged individually in the Contributors Table for their specific contributions with emoji keys reflecting specific contributions made with the organisational support. Their contributors will be listed under their organisation's name in the contributor's file.
